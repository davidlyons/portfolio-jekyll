# grunt + jekyll + github pages

Custom website boilerplate

- run 'npm install'

- run `grunt`. this handles scss and js processing with sourcemaps, runs a jekyll build, runs and opens a local server, watches for changes, and live reloads.

- change `_config.yml` > `baseurl:` to the name of the github repo, or leave it empty for a user page
