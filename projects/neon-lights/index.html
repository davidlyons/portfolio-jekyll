	<p>Under Neon Lights is a an interactive WebVR music experience set to The Chemical Brothers' track under the same name featuring St. Vincent. It is a psychological coming-of-age experience that guides a young girl from her suburban home through the city as she navigates three distinct stages of her life.</p>

	<p>I worked on this project with a team at <a href="https://www.with.in/watch/under-neon-lights">WITHIN</a> at the beginning of 2017. I was responsible for adding WebVR support, assembling the intro scene and start button UI, and animating the girl's face. The bulk of the project was assembled using <a href="https://github.com/mrdoob/frame.js/">Frame.js</a>, a web editor that is similar to Premiere, but with code sequences instead of video sequences. Under Neon Lights was also a part of Google's <a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/under-neon-lights">WebVR Experiments</a>, so the team open sourced the working files on <a href="https://github.com/within-unlimited/under-neon-lights">GitHub</a>. Check out Jono Brandel's <a href="https://works.jonobr1.com/Under-Neon-Lights">write up</a> as well.</p>

	<p>In March 2017, I animated the eyes blinking and mouth lip syncing to the lyrics of the song using three planes parented to the head bone and a sprite sheet texture map, sliding the UV offset around on the sprite sheet. <a href="https://medium.com/@gordonnl/links-expressions-eb7beae2c62c">Windwaker Link</a> was both a technical and visual inspiration and reference for the face.</p>
