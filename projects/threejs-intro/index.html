	<p>In 2014, I put together this introduction to Three.js presentation for <a href="http://frontporch.io/">Front Porch</a>, a front end web developer conference in Dallas, Texas. WebGL still felt relatively new to both myself and other front end devs I knew. When I was first getting started, I learned a lot by reverse engineering Three.js examples. My goal for this presentation was to teach devs without any 3D experience how to get started with Three.js. There was a 20 minute time limit for the presentation, so the information is fairly condensed. I wanted to quickly explain 3D graphics fundamentals in the context of Three.js and front end web development, breaking things down into simple terms that would be easy to understand, supported by visual examples and code snippets.</p>
