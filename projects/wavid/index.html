	<p>In January 2017, I joined a team of five people for Global Game Jam at USC. These were characters that I modeled and painted in Maya and ZBrush in one weekend for the game jam, while the rest of my team worked in Unity. The theme for the game jam was <strong>waves</strong>, so the original idea for our game was a third-person pool floaty adventure. First we came up with names for each of the floaties, starting with Wavid, an inflatable giraffe pool floaty. Then we came up with names and taglines for each of his missing children using more wave puns, and designed them based on the names. Like <a href={{ "/projects/codevember17" | relative_url }}>Codevember</a>, game jams are an exercise in time management. Because we only had three days to make the game, we had to keep things very simple, so most of the floaties re-use the same model as Wavid, but have different texture paint, or small edits to the original geometry. At the end of the game jam, we put our Unity build up on <a href="https://davidlyons.itch.io/wavid">Itch.io</a> for download. I later tried to start on a <a href="http://davidscottlyons.com/wavid">WebGL version</a> with a more user-friendly WASD, arrow key and XBox controller input for traditional third-person locomotion, and tested out <a href="https://github.com/lo-th/Oimo.js/">oimo.js</a>, a Three.js physics library, for character collisions.</p>
