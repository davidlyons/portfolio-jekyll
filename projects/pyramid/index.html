	<p>In 2010, I used a pyramid speaker concept drawing by Melody Neumann to make an interactive 2D Flash version of the pyramid with vectors I made in Illustrator and sound files I made in Guitar Pro and Reason. Clicking each speaker played a different sound file. In 2013, I modeled a 3D version of the pyramid in Maya, and made a 3D version of the Flash app with Three.js. This was one of my first Three.js toys.</p>
