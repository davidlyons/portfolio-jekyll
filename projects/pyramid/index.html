	<p>In 2010, while I was still in school, before I knew about Three.js, I modeled a 3D pyramid speaker based on a concept drawing by Melody Neumann. I used Maya's vector renderer to render a 2D vector of one angle the 3D model, and then brought the vectors into Flash to make the speakers interactive. Clicking each speaker played a different sound file I made with Guitar Pro and Reason.</p>

	<p>After learning about Three.js in 2012, I made an interactive 3D version of the Flash pyramid. This was one of my first Three.js experiments, and one of the first projects where I used <a href="https://threejs.org/examples/webgl_interactive_cubes">raycasting</a>.</p>
