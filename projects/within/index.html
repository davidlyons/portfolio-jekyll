	<p>From 2015 to 2018, I was a software engineer on <a href="https://www.with.in/">WITHIN</a>'s spherical video + binaural audio webplayer and <a href="https://vr.with.in/">WebVR platform</a>. I implemented the 3D user interface elements for usability in WebVR, including a cylindrical paginated thumbnail grid, lake environment, video detail view with play and back buttons, video player controls with replay, pause/play, resolution and back buttons, and a timeline seek bar with Three.js and vanilla javascript. The detail view and video controls used <a href="{{ "/projects/text-sdf-bitmap/" | relative_url }}">SDF Bitmap Text</a>, and I added support for VR displays and VR controllers with the WebVR API and Gamepad API.</p>

	<p>Supported devices include Oculus Rift, Vive, Windows MR, Oculus Go, GearVR and Daydream. A user with any of these headsets and a browser that supports WebVR can select "Enter VR" to browse and watch a curated collection of spherical videos within their web browser. I frequently tested the site and fixed bugs on each of these platforms to ensure they were working in their supported browser.</p>

	<p>WebVR is generally headset agnostic. Remaining accessible with controller fragmentation can be a challenge. But thanks to a fork of Stewart Smith's <a href="https://github.com/davidlyons/THREE.VRController">THREE.VRController</a>, you can access the state of any button or axes on any controller connected through the Gamepad API. Any 3DOF or 6DOF controller should be able to "hover" over a user interface element by pointing at it with a raycast, and selecting it with a primary button press. Controller models are loaded in to match the user's controller when it is connected. A user with Oculus Touch controllers will see Oculus Touch controllers, Oculus Go users will see an Oculus Go controller, etc. Users can also use a mouse, XBox controller, keyboard arrow keys and spacebar, or 0DOF DPad (like the Oculus Remote) to navigate the interface.</p>
