	<p>From 2015 to 2018, I worked on <a href="https://www.with.in/">WITHIN</a>'s spherical video webplayer and WebVR site. I implemented VR user interface elements, including the paginated thumbnail grid, detail view and video player controls with <a href="{{ "/projects/text-sdf-bitmap/" || relative_url }}">SDF Bitmap Text</a>, and added support for VR displays and VR controllers with the WebVR API and Gamepad API. Supported devices include Oculus Rift, Vive, Windows MR, Oculus Go, GearVR and Daydream. A user with one of these devices and a browser that supports WebVR can select "Enter VR" to browse and watch a curated collection of spherical videos within their web browser. Users can also use an XBox controller or keyboard to navigate the interface.</p>
