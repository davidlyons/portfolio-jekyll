      <p class="lead">Hi, my name is David and I create interactive 3D web graphics.</p>

      <p>
        As a 3D artist, design engineer and front end web developer with over 10 years of experience, I collaborate with
        cross-disciplinary teams to translate 2D concept art into real-time 3D models and animations, and translate
        static UX designs into clean, functional, responsive and accessible HTML, SCSS and Javascript.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-5">
        While my current favorite tools include Three.js, React, Storybook, VS Code, Blender and ZBrush, my
        understanding of the fundamental concepts can transfer to any application, and I'm always learning,
        experimenting and exploring new ways to combine my creative and technical skills.
