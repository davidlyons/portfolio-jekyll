			<p>Hi, I'm David Lyons. I live in Los Angeles, California. I have a passion for art and technology and I'm always learning new things to combine my creative and technical skills.</p>

			<p>I've been drawing since I was a kid and I've been doing web design and development since about 2001 as a hobby so that I could put my art online where anyone can easily access it. In high school, art and computer science were my favorite classes, and I spent a lot of my time making Flash animations and HTML/CSS layouts.</p>

			<p>In December 2010, I graduated from Texas A&M University with a Bachelor's of Science in Visualization. The program was a mix of visual art and computer science classes, with a focus on the theory behind 3D graphics, animation principles, and pipelines for film and games. I started with 3DS Max and later switched to Maya, but the concepts learned could be applied to any software. Courses also included painting, graphic design and motion graphics.</p>

			<p>After I graduated from Texas A&M, I started doing front end web development professionally at two different advertising agencies in Dallas, working on big brand responsive websites with large teams, while practicing digital sculpting in ZBrush and 3D printing at the Dallas Makerspace in my personal time.</p>

			<p>When web browsers shifted away from Flash around 2010 and started supporting WebGL in 2011, I was inspired to learn Three.js, which allowed me to mix both worlds: 3D and the web. Soon after the release of the first Oculus Rift developer kit in 2013, WebVR was created to use VR devices in a web browser through WebGL. In 2015, after researching and exploring WebVR, I moved to Los Angeles to do software engineering and 3D user interfaces on WebVR projects with a virtual reality startup here.</p>

			<p>Currently, I'm getting back into more 3D art while continuing to improve my front end and WebGL/VR/AR/XR 3D web development knowledge.</p>
