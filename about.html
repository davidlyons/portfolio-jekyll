        Hi, my name is David Lyons. I'm a front end web developer and 3D artist specializing in
        real-time, interactive 3D graphics
        <br class="d-none d-sm-block d-md-none" />
        on the web.

        I collaborate with cross-disciplinary teams to bridge the gap between UX / design and code.
        With over 10 years of experience in the constantly changing digital landscape, I'm always
        learning, experimenting and looking for new ways to combine my creative and technical
        skills.

      <p>
        I started doing web design and development around 2001. In high school, art and computer
        science were my favorite classes, and I spent a lot of my time making vectors and animations
        with Flash and web page layouts with HTML and CSS.
      </p>

      <p>
        At Texas A&M University, I studied Visualization: a mix of 3D animation pipelines for film
        and games (including modeling, texturing, lighting, rigging, animation and rendering with
        3DS Max and Maya), computer science, graphic design, motion graphics, drawing and painting.
        Classes focused on theory and animation principles so that concepts could be applied to any
        software.
      </p>

      <p>
        After I graduated in 2010, I spent a few years doing front end web development on responsive
        marketing websites for brands at two different advertising agencies in Dallas, TX.
        Meanwhile, I began practicing digital sculpting in ZBrush, 3D printing at the Dallas
        Makerspace, and experimenting with WebGL and WebVR with Three.js, which allowed me to mix
        both worlds:<br class="d-none d-xl-block"> 3D and the web.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 2015, I moved to Los Angeles to develop 3D user interfaces for a 360 video WebVR platform
        using Three.js at a virtual reality startup.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, I'm freelancing and continuing to learn more about 3D graphics, front end web
        development, modern Javascript frameworks, software engineering, WebGL and WebXR.
