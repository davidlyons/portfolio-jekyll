	<p>Hi, I'm David Lyons. I live in Los Angeles, California. I have a passion for art and technology and I'm always learning new things to combine my creative and technical skills.</p>

	<p>I started doing web design and development around 2001 as a hobby so that I could put my art online where anyone can easily access it. In high school, art and computer science were my favorite classes, and I spent a lot of my time making vectors and animations with Flash and web page layouts with HTML and CSS.</p>

	<p>At Texas A&M University, I studied Visualization: a mix of 3D animation pipelines for film and games (including modeling, texturing, lighting, rigging, animation and rendering with 3DS Max and Maya), computer science, graphic design, motion graphics, drawing and painting. Classes focused on theory and animation principles so that concepts could be applied to any software.</p>

	<p>After I graduated in 2010, I started doing front end web development professionally at two different advertising agencies in Dallas, working on responsive marketing websites for big brands with large teams, while practicing digital sculpting in ZBrush, 3D printing at the Dallas Makerspace, and experimenting with WebGL and WebVR with Three.js, which allowed me to mix both worlds: 3D and the web. In 2015, I moved to Los Angeles to do software engineering and develop 3D user interfaces on WebVR projects with a virtual reality startup.</p>

	<p>Currently, I'm freelancing and continuing to improve my 3D graphics, front end web development, software engineering, WebGL and WebXR knowledge.</p>
