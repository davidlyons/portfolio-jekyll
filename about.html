			<p>Hi, I'm David and I'm from Dallas, TX. I've been drawing ever since I was a kid and I've been doing web design and development since about 2001 as a hobby so that I could put my art online where anyone can easily access it. Art and computer science were my favorite classes all four years of high school, and I spent a lot of my free time making Flash animations and custom layouts for Neopets and MySpace.</p>

			<p>In December 2010, I graduated from Texas A&M University with a Bachelor's of Science in Visualization. The program was a mix of visual art and computer science classes, with a focus on the theory for 3D graphics concepts that could be applied to any software. I got into 3DS Max and Maya for VFX and 3D animation pipelines for film and games, and also took classes for painting, graphic design and motion graphics.</p>

			<p>After I graduated, I started doing front end web development professionally at two different ad agencies in Dallas, working on big brand cross-browser responsive websites with large teams, while practicing digital sculpting in ZBrush and 3D printing at the Dallas Makerspace in my personal time.</p>

			<p>When web browsers stopped supporting Flash around 2010 and started supporting WebGL around 2011, I was inspired to learn Three.js. These new tools were a mix of both worlds: 3D and the web. Soon after the release of the first Oculus Rift developer kit in 2013, WebVR was created to use VR devices in a web browser through WebGL. I researched WebVR as much as I could, and then in 2015, I moved to Los Angeles to pursue an opportunity to do software engineering on WebVR projects with a virtual reality startup here.</p>

			<p>Currently I'm getting back into more 3D art while continuing to improve my front end, 3D and VR/AR web development knowledge. I'm always trying to learn new things and combine both my creative and technical skills.</p>
