      <p class="lead">Hi, my name is David and I create interactive 3D web graphics.</p>

      <p>
        As a front end web developer, design engineer and 3D artist with over 10 years of experience, I collaborate with
        cross-disciplinary teams to translate 2D concept art into real-time 3D models and animations, and translate
        static UX designs into clean, functional, responsive and accessible HTML, SCSS and Javascript.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-5">
        My current favorite tools include React, Gatsby, Storybook, VS Code, Three.js, Blender and ZBrush, but I'm
        always learning, experimenting and exploring new ways to combine my creative and technical skills.
